# Simple SIR example built on the high-level run_sir() runner (R/models.R),
# rather than wiring the per-tick step kernels together by hand. This script
# defines run_sir_model(), does some setup, then calls it.
#
# Run from anywhere:  Rscript examples/simple_sir.R

# `library(pkg)` attaches a package so its exported names resolve unqualified
# (like a wildcard `import`); the package name is given bare, not as a string.

# `function(args) body` is a first-class closure value, bound here with `<-`.
# `scenario` is a data.frame with one row per patch (name, population, latitude,
# longitude); it is the model's geographic scaffold. `network` is the N x N
# spatial coupling matrix (fraction of each patch's force of infection exported
# to every other patch).

# Locate this script's directory so the data file resolves no matter the working
# directory. `commandArgs(FALSE)` returns ALL launch args including Rscript's own
# `--file=<path>`; `grep(..., value = TRUE)` returns the matching element, `sub`
# strips the prefix, and `dirname` takes the directory part. The `else "."`
# fallback covers being sourced interactively.

# Load the England & Wales measles patches (954 registration districts): one row
# per node with its name, initial (1944) population, and latitude/longitude.
# `read.csv` returns a data.frame; `file.path` joins paths OS-correctly. The CSV
# is produced from EnglandWalesMeasles.py by examples/data/convert_measles.py.

# Pairwise great-circle distances (km) between every patch, from their
# latitude/longitude. `distances()` returns a symmetric N x N matrix with a zero
# diagonal; it is the geographic input from which the spatial coupling network is
# built (e.g. via a gravity model). `$` reaches a data.frame column by name.

# Spatial coupling network from the radiation model (Simini et al., Nature 2012):
# given each patch's population and the pairwise distances, it estimates the
# migration weight between every ordered pair of patches. `include_home = FALSE`
# excludes a patch's own population from the "intervening opportunities" sum.
network <- radiation(scenario$population, distance_matrix, k = 1, include_home = FALSE)

# The transmission kernel reads the network as the FRACTION of each patch's force
# of infection exported to every other patch, so a row sum is that patch's total
# emigration fraction and must be at most 1. `row_normalizer` proportionally
# scales down any row that exceeds the cap; here we limit every patch to at most
# 10% total emigration.
