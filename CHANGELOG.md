## Unreleased

### Added
- `run_sir()` — a high-level **model runner** that assembles the per-tick step
  kernels and their parameters into a single call (`R/models.R`). It takes a node
  data.frame (one row per node, an integer `population` column), builds an agent
  `LaserFrame` sized to the total population, assigns each agent to its node,
  seeds initial infections, and runs the downstream-first SIR loop (recovery I→R
  before transmission S→I). It records per-node compartment trajectories (`S`,
  `I`, `R`) and per-tick flows (`incidence` S→I, `recovery` I→R) into a node-level
  report `LaserFrame` attached as `attr(model, "report")`, alongside `runtime`,
  `nticks`, `model`, and `parameters` attributes. `infectious_period` accepts a
  `Distribution` or a bare number (promoted to `dist_constant`), and `progress`
  draws a text progress bar. Intended as the reference template for `run_seir()`,
  `run_si()`, `run_sis()`, … Covered by `tests/testthat/test-run_sir.R`
  (node assignment, seeding, population conservation, flow-vs-delta identities,
  cross-node isolation, attribute surface, and argument validation).
- Two **generalized timer-expiry kernels** (mirroring laser-generic's
  `nb_timer_update` and `nb_timer_update_timer_set`), parameterized by the
  `from`/`to` state codes so any timer-driven transition can be expressed without
  a bespoke kernel:
  - `step_timer_expire(people, from_state, to_state)` — transition into an
    *absorbing* (untimed) state; the timer is left at 0 on arrival (e.g. I→S, R→S).
  - `step_timer_expire_set(people, from_state, to_state, duration_dist)` —
    transition into a state with *its own* duration; a fresh per-agent timer is
    drawn from `duration_dist` on arrival (e.g. E→I, I→R with waning).
  The four named kernels (`step_exposed_ei`, `step_infectious_ir`,
  `step_infectious_is`, `step_recovered_rs`) are now thin, fixed-state wrappers
  over these two helpers, so the shared decrement/transition loop lives in one
  place. Covered by `tests/testthat/test-timer-kernels.R`, which proves the
  wrappers are equivalent to the generalized kernels.
- `distributions` module exposing parameterized probability distributions to R as
  opaque `Distribution` handles. Constructors use a `dist_` prefix to avoid masking
  base/stats functions (e.g. `base::gamma`, `stats::poisson`):
  - `dist_normal(mean, variance)` — Gaussian (second argument is the variance σ²,
    not the standard deviation).
  - `dist_constant(value)` — degenerate distribution; a fixed-value drop-in.
  - `dist_uniform(low, high)` — continuous uniform on `[low, high)`.
  - `dist_gamma(shape, scale)` — gamma in the shape–scale (k, θ) parameterization
    (mean `shape*scale`, variance `shape*scale^2`); strictly positive draws.
  - `dist_poisson(lambda)` — Poisson with rate/mean `lambda`; non-negative integer
    counts.
  - `dist_beta(alpha, beta)` — beta on `(0, 1)` with shape parameters α, β.
  - `dist_exp(rate)` — exponential with rate λ (mean `1/rate`).
  - `dist_logistic(location, scale)` — logistic (mean `location`, variance
    `scale^2·π²/3`); sampled by inverse-CDF transform.
  - `dist_lognormal(meanlog, sdlog)` — log-normal with log-space parameters
    (matches R's `qlnorm`).
- `Distribution$sample_one()` and `Distribution$sample_n(n)` — draw one / a batch
  of floating-point samples with a thread-local RNG (for interactive use, testing,
  and statistical validation). All draws are doubles.
- Internal Rust sampler `Distribution::sample` (Pattern B): the caller supplies the
  RNG, so one `&Distribution` can be shared by reference and sampled concurrently
  across Rayon worker threads.
- `tests/testthat/test-distributions.R` covering the constructors and their use in
  the step kernels, and `tests/testthat/test-distributions-validation.R` validating
  parameter wiring against R's reference implementations (`qnorm`, `qunif`,
  `qgamma`, `qpois`/`dpois`) over one million draws.
- `examples/sir_attack_fraction.R` and `examples/seir_attack_fraction.R` —
  runnable SIR and SEIR examples that plot the compartment trajectories and
  compare the simulated final attack fraction against the Kermack–McKendrick
  final-size relation `A = 1 - exp(-R0 * A)` across an `R0` sweep, with timing
  output (with `examples/README.md` and sample output plots).
- `CLAUDE.md` documenting the downstream-first transition-ordering convention for
  composing models from the step kernels.

### Changed
- Model compositions (SIR/SEIR/SEIRS test helpers and the examples) now call the
  per-tick transitions **downstream-first** (out of each timed compartment before
  into it: R→S, I→R, E→I, S→E) so that exposed/infectious periods reflect their
  full configured duration rather than being shortened by one tick. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- Distributions return **floating-point** values; the integer rounding for state
  timers now lives in the step kernels (a shared `duration_ticks` helper rounds to
  the nearest tick and clamps to a minimum of 1). `Distribution` no longer exposes
  an integer `sample_duration`.
- Every step that transitions an agent **into** a timed state takes a `Distribution`
  for that state's duration instead of a fixed `i32`. The duration is drawn per
  agent at the moment of transition. Pass `dist_constant(d)` for fixed-duration
  behavior or e.g. `dist_normal(mean, variance)` for a stochastic period:
  - `step_transmission_si(people, nodes, beta, inf_dist)` — was `inf_duration`
    (sets the **I** timer on S→I).
  - `step_transmission_se(people, nodes, beta, exp_dist)` — was `exp_duration`
    (sets the **E** timer on S→E).
  - `step_exposed_ei(people, inf_dist)` — was `inf_duration`
    (sets the **I** timer on E→I).
  - `step_infectious_ir(people, imm_dist)` — was `imm_duration`
    (sets the **R** waning timer on I→R; use `dist_constant(0)` for SIR/SEIR where
    the R timer is never read).
  Steps transitioning into untimed states (`step_infectious_is`,
  `step_recovered_rs`, `step_mortality_cdr`, `step_births_cbr`) are unchanged.
  All SI/SIR/SEIR/SEIRS test helpers updated to wrap their durations in
  `dist_constant()`.
